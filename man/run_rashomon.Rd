\usage{
run_rashomon(X, y, pmax = 5, m = 90, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix containing predictor variables. Column names
are treated as variable identifiers.}

\item{y}{A numeric response vector with length equal to the number of rows in
\code{X}.}

\item{pmax}{Integer. Maximum model dimension (largest number of predictors
allowed in any model). Defaults to \code{5}.}

\item{m}{Integer. Number of candidate models to generate at each dimension.
Passed to internal functions such as \code{fit_models_dim()} and
\code{grow_from()}. Defaults to \code{90}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. AIC tolerance parameter used by \code{select_best()} to
identify near-optimal models. Smaller values are more selective. Defaults
to \code{0.5}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{M}}{A list of length \code{pmax}. Each element \code{M[[k]]}
    contains a data frame of the best retained models at dimension \eqn{k},
    typically including fields such as \code{vars} (predictor sets) and
    \code{aic}.}

  \item{\code{predictor_counts}}{A list of data frames. For each dimension,
    reports how many times each predictor appears among the retained models.}

  \item{\code{aic_summary}}{A data frame with columns \code{dimension} and
    \code{aic}, containing the AIC values for all retained models across all
    dimensions.}
}
}
\description{
Executes a sequential model–growing workflow to explore a Rashomon set of
models across increasing model dimensions. For each dimension \eqn{k}, the
function fits many candidate models, evaluates them using an AIC-based
selection rule, and retains only the near-optimal subset. These retained
models are expanded to dimension \eqn{k+1}, continuing until \code{pmax}.
The function also produces summaries of predictor usage and AIC distributions.
}
\details{
The procedure follows these steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Initializes storage for models across dimensions.
  \item Fits all 1-predictor models using \code{fit_models_dim()} and selects
        the best subset with \code{select_best()}.
  \item For dimensions \eqn{k = 2, \ldots, pmax}, expands the previously
        selected models using \code{grow_from()} and again filters them with
        \code{select_best()}.
  \item Computes counts of how often each predictor appears in the selected
        models at each dimension.
  \item Produces an AIC summary table useful for boxplots and other
        diagnostics.
